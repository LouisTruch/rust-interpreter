# Rust-interpreter
This a simple interpreter written in Rust. It is based on the book ["Writing an Interpreter in Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/) by [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/).
It interprets a simple and not-so-far-from-C language. You can see at the [bottom of this page](https://interpreterbook.com/) what does the lang looks like.

## Why ?
This repo/crate has not the pretention to be a fully working interpreter, nor to be the best implementation. I started this project for sole purpose of **learning**.

## Usage
To run the REPL

```
cargo run
```
